		<h1> My Story </h1>
	<p id="stor"> When I was in 2nd year of my university, I along with my three friends were  travelling in Netrokona, Birishiri during our semester break time. We started our journey from Mohakhali, Dhaka at 7.00 am. After a long but peaceful and safe journey , we reached Birishiri at 4.00 pm. I mentioned that during our journey we faced some traffic problem as like the road was so dirty and the width of the road  was too small. After reaching we easily found a nice  room for passing the night. You will not trust that the rent of that room only 400 tk. After completing the room problem we went out of room to outside at Birishiri. We enjoyed a lot in that evening such as introduced with the tribe, taking selfies, after all we took grill that night as our dinner. We woke up at the very beginning and take some breakfast we went out from the room via rickshaw. First, we visited the 'Padma-Bagan' with some beautiful flower. After that we crossed the river and went to 'Sada-Matir-Pahar'. I couldn't brief that most most beautiful moment , just i wanna to say awesome. We climbed rock and taking some different color stone. After passing one an half hour we returned at our room. Taking 20 min rest ,again went out for 'Garo-Pahar' . At 'Garo-Pahar' we climbed different rock and we were too much tired. At that moment we took the video that link is given bellow. That was our journey , we enjoyed too much. It was a memorable day for me as like as for my two other friends. </p>
